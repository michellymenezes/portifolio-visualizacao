# Visualizations' Portfolio

Portfolio: https://michellymenezes.github.io/portifolio-visualizacao

This portfolio is a set of works related to data visualization. The structure is like blog and posts where I select a theme and build up visualizations with some storytelling.

Among the used technologies I can highlight **D3js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

Here you can find visualizations like:

* Barchart
* Heatmap
* Maps
* Streamgraph
* Scatterplot
